# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 - Rust Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) implemented in Rust.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
cargo run -- --day 1
```

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

## 📝 Progress

| Day                        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Notes |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| [Day 1](src/days/day01.rs) | ⭐     | ⭐     |       |
| [Day 2](src/days/day02.rs) | ⭐     | ⭐     |       |
| [Day 3](src/days/day03.rs) |        |        |       |

## 🛠 Implementation Details

Solutions are implemented with the following considerations:

- Each day's solution is a separate binary in `src/days/`
- Input files are read from the `input/` directory (not committed)
- Tests are included for each day's solution
